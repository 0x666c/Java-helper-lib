This is my collection of methods and constants which helped me throughout my coding practice.<br><br>
Feel free to push any code that can help somebody and/or helped you, but please, put simple methods in 'Useful.java' and
constansts, methods which require fields, collections of methods related to one thing into another class(es).
<br><br>
Also the code is not licensed by any means, so you are free to use it anywhere you want :)
(but please credit me ok?)
